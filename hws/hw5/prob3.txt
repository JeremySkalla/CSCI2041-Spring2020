Solution to Problem 3
=====================

The definition of the reverse function:

let rec rev lst1 lst2 =
   match lst1 with
   |  [] -> lst2
   |  (h::t) -> rev t (h::lst2)

let reverse lst = in rev lst []


Solution to Part (a)
--------------------

For all lists l1, for all lists l2, (rev l1 l2) = l2 + l1^r
P(l1) refers to the first variable here


Solution to Part (b)
--------------------

Base Case:
    P([]) -> (rev [] l2) = l2 + []^r
    By the definition of rev, if lst1 is [], it returns lst2, so
    l2 = l2 + []^r, and an empty list reversed is still an empty list,
    and we know that for all lists l, l + [] is the same as l, so,
    we now have our equation that looks like:
    l2 = l2, and since l2 is arbitrary, Base Case Holds

Inductive Step:
    Assume P(l1)
    P((h::l1)) -> (rev (h::l1) l2) = l2 + (h::l1)^R
    We know that by the definition of rev, the left hand side can change to:
    (rev l1 (h::l2)) = l2 + (h::l1)^R,
    but we also know that  (x::l1)^R + l2 is the same as l1^R + (x::l2), so,
    our equation now is:
    (rev l1 (h::l2)) = (h::l2) + l1^R, and by the induction hypothesis, the left side
    evaluates to whatever l2 + l1^r evaluates to, so now our equation is
    (h::l2) + l1^R = (h::l2) + l1^R, and now both sides have the same
    termination behavior and values, so the Inductive Step is done


Solution to Part (c)
--------------------

The property for reverse to be proved:
     For all lists l, (reverse l) evaluates to l^R.

For all lists l, (reverse l) evaluates to whatever (rev l []), and since
we proved, in part 2, that (rev l1 l2) evaluates to l2 + l1^R, we now have
[] + l^R, and since we know that for all lists l, l + [] is the same as l,
that becomes just l^R, which makes the equation l^R = l^R, which has
the same termination behavior and values, proving our property.
