# Git Cheat Sheet

* config: Git config allows us to set up our profile. This just allows us more customization.
* clone: Duplicates (clones) a repository into a new directory. This is useful for keeping track of your files on your local machine and github
* remote: Allows us to work with remote repositories. Useful for collaborating with others.
* status: Shows us the status of what files have been updated on our local version of the repository. Useful for checking which files you need to add and what your commit note should be.
* commit: Records changes to the repository. Normally with a brief note about what was changed since you last pushed files.
* push: Updates (pushes) the data from our local repository (that we have added and committed) to the online version. Used at the end of all file changes to update in your github repository.
* pull: Opposite of push. Checks and updates (or creates) files on the local machine to be in sync with the online version. If there's already a newer version on your local machine, you'll have some conflicts and it will generally resolve them. Used when updating local machine files.
* add: Adds a file that git should track so it can be put into your online repository. This needs to be ran before you push anything.
